      <description>In this course I learned:
 How to configure travis (seems pretty similar to CircleCi and Gitlab) A bit more about Hugo (and Hugo seems really nice &amp;lt;3) More about github access tokens  I also developed a bit more paranoia about github access keys, as it seems like one can&#39;t define the keys per repo. This is bad, as the keys can leak and allow questionable actors to change my other repos.</description>

      <description>I decided to take this course, as I was missing one (1) credit from my thesis and this seemed interesting. I am writing my thesis about DevOps, so ROI should be okay :]
I feel that DevOps done right (eg. really applied and not just advocated) is a good way to make software development less wasteful and alleviate the deployment pain. In my thesis research I found interesting book about DevOps and it&#39;s impact.</description>
