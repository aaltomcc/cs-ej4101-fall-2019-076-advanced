	<b> About me</b>
	<p> I am a strange loop stuck in a meat body. Operationally compromised and not backed up. Currently working to get my thesis ready and then preparing for the imminent collapse of fossil-capitalism. I spend my days thinking about the extinction event we are in middle of and how could we alleviate it. I care deeply about open source and I am horrified of the current software and hardware ecosystem around social media and closed-source, plannedly obsolete hardware. I like looking at the stars and learning about all the ways human existence is broken and different from our savanna-poet evolutinary background.<p/>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>In this course I learned:
 How to configure travis (seems pretty similar to CircleCi and Gitlab) A bit more about Hugo (and Hugo seems really nice &lt;3) More about github access tokens  I also developed a bit more paranoia about github access keys, as it seems like one can't define the keys per repo. This is bad, as the keys can leak and allow questionable actors to change my other repos.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I decided to take this course, as I was missing one (1) credit from my thesis and this seemed interesting. I am writing my thesis about DevOps, so ROI should be okay :]
I feel that DevOps done right (eg. really applied and not just advocated) is a good way to make software development less wasteful and alleviate the deployment pain. In my thesis research I found interesting book about DevOps and it's impact.  … </p>
