In this course I learned:
* How to configure travis (seems pretty similar to CircleCi and Gitlab)
* A bit more about Hugo (and Hugo seems really nice <3)
* More about github access tokens

I also developed a bit more paranoia about github access keys, as it
seems like one can't define the keys per repo. This is bad, as the
keys can leak and allow questionable actors to change my other
repos. So I'll remove the keys after the course is done.

Github does not support setting expiration date to access keys. Having
expiration date on the key would solve my use case neatly, as the key
could be set to expire automatically after this course is done.


Yep, secrets management is hard :(

Another thing I learned (once again) static files are still
non-trivial in hugo. I could not find a quick way to add consistently
templatable images to this blog. But it does not matter, as the
life-cycle of this blog will be really short, so clunky image-symlinks
will suffice this time. But I should take a bit time to learn hugo
better, If I plan to use it later. It feels nice and quick to use and
pretty damn easy to deploy.

And I think static sites are the way forward in this js-maddened
world. It's absurd how bloated and ad-infested the current internet
is. And the problem does not seem to be fixing itself. At least there
will be huge amount of maintenance work for all the coders of the
world(yay...). If this society survives the ecological disaster we
have worked so hard to create by not pricing externalities like carbon
emission.

Time will tell, at least it will be interesting to see how this
chaotic system evolves.
