In this course I learned:
* How to configure travis (seems pretty similar to CircleCi and Gitlab)
* A bit more about Hugo (and Hugo seems really nice <3)

I also developed a bit more paranoia about github access keys, as it
seems like one can't define the keys per repo. This is bad, as the
keys can leak and allow questionable actors to change my other
repos. So I'll remove the keys after the course is done.

Yep, secrets management is hard :(
