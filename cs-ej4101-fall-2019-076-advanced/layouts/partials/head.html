	<b> About me</b>
	<p> I am a strange loop stuck in a meat body. Operationally compromised and not backed up. Currently working to get my thesis ready and then preparing for the imminent collapse of fossil-capitalism. I spend my days thinking about the extinction event we are in middle of and how could we alleviate it. I care deeply about open source and I am horrified of the current software and hardware ecosystem around social media and closed-source, plannedly obsolete hardware. I like looking at the stars and learning about all the ways human existence is broken and different from our savanna-poet evolutinary background.<p/>
